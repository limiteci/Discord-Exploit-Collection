- Collection of both patched and unpatched bugs, exploits, API abuses and other strange and exploitable features and illusions in the [Discord](https://discord.com) app.

## Some other unpatched exploits I haven't figured out how works yet

- Anti Phone Lock (prevent Discord's security system from phone locking your account)
- Anti Disconnect (prevent other users from disconnecting you from any public voice channel)

Let me know, if anything is missing or if you have any exploits, on my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/FYvnFy2)
